SCORECARD INSTRUCTIONS
Note: this tool is intended to be a prototype rather than a live tool, so there are some areas where the flexibility does not reach production standards - for example, grant applications can only have up to 4 milestones and organizations 4 individuals profiled. That said, it is intended to be functional.


NEW GRANT INPUT
To create a new example, you would make one copy of the org profile tab and grant request tab, and 1-4 copies of the other tabs in blue and yellow (Individual profile, org audit, etc.) The appropriate people would fill out each of these, and then when they are ready for evaluation, you would go to the Data Parser tab and fill in the names of the tabs you created in the Input Config section.

If you create more records than was in the original sample, you may need to fill across, and there may be other tweaks that are needed to the data parser - we would be happy to address with you if you contact us at devxdao@ramprate.com with a subject that includes "DEVxDAO scorecard"


GRANT SCORING
To score the example, the main intended functionality is to adjust the top-level weights on the VA Front Page, either by entering numbers into column F or using the sliders just to the right.

However, VAs can also change the detailed underlying weights that translate individual line items and questions into those category scores. In the VA Detailed Scorecard Config tab, you can change the weights in column C - by default they're in the 1-10 range, but you can use any positive integers.

You can also assign dealbreaker questions - e.g. eliminating orgs headquartered in sanctioned locations or those that are delinquent on existing grants. You would do this in the VA Dealbreakers tab

A very deep dive config can also include changing the lookup tables tab, which changes how drop-down answers translate into scores.

As with the above process, we're happy to answer any questions or identify bugs if you contact us at devxdao@ramprate.com with a subject that includes "DEVxDAO scorecard"
